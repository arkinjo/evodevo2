# evodevo2
Computational modelling of evolutionary developmental systems (Second attempt).
These codes are for evolutionary simulations of developmental gene regulatory networks.
The first version was written in Go and is available at https://github.com/arkinjo/evodevo. 
That version served its purpose well, but had some limitations regarding extensibility.
The current version will be implemented more systematically so that we can try different variations of the GRN models more easily.
